## 3. Downloading OS X (macOS)

From the Sidebar of /r/Hackintosh

OS X INSTALLERS NOTE: This sub is dedicated to legally obtained copies of OS X. Please do not ask, or post, about things like iAtkos, Niresh, or any other modified OS X installer that may have malicious code in it!

I handle it exactly the same. You can download the Installer.dmg from the Mac AppStore, everything else could've been messed with.

## 4. Installer USB

ALL DATA ON YOUR USB DRIVE WILL BE FORMATTED WITH THIS PROCESS!

*   Plug in your USB drive with a minimum of 8GiB of Storage
*   Open _Disk Utility_
